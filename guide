{
    "Programming_Languages": "Java",
    "Frameworks": "Django, Unity, Vue.js, 'Numpy'",
    "Databases": "",
    "DevOps_Tools": "AWS, Ansible, Apache, Azure",
    "Happy_in_Current_Role": 0,
    "Current_Role_Difficulty": 1
}


there is a correlation between this variables   "Programming_Languages""Frameworks""Databases""DevOps_Tools" so when you test don't forget to change the values of "Happy_in_Current_Role": 
    "Current_Role_Difficulty" to see another result
